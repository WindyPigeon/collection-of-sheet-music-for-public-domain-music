This is a sheet music transcribed based on the lyrics sheet attached to the shellac record "夜上海/星心相印" (catalog number: 35645) released by Pathé Records in 1946.

The lyrics in the lyrics sheet have the music notation of the lead melody written in the form of numbered notation for reference.

It should be noted that the lyrics in the lyrics sheet are different from the actual lyrics used in the recording.
In the recording, Zhou Xuan sang the lyrics in the 19th bar as "轉動的車輪", but in this lyrics sheet, the lyrics here are "車輪轉動".
